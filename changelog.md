Magicality Changelog
====================

Unreleased
----------
* More sensible burn time vs. EMC settings. Coal is now 32 EMC, ProjectE fuel recipes were changed so their EMC values are as unchanged as possible (only alchemical fuel has half it's previous EMC now). Burn times were changed accordingly, all ProjectE fuels therefore burn now significantly longer.
* Removed and (if necessary) replaced all AMT recipes that use tin or silver. This also gets rid of the empty bottle/bottle case exploit (Fixes Issue #5)
* Fixed diamond to emerald transmutation exploit. Recipe now requires 8 iron ingots
* Fixed dm recipe so it's no longer a massive EMC gain
* Changed some recipes that use dm/rm blocks so they don't suffer that much from making the matter blocks regular storage blocks
* Fixed some quest text typos / omissions
* Made it possible to get ender shards in the overworld. No spoilers, but there is a hint in your beginner shard entry =)
* Shards gained an EMC value, removed (were never intended to have one)
* Changed emerald shard recipe (Fixes Issue #16)
* Gem of Eternal Density now requires red matter (Fixes Issue #17)
* Make red matter quest detection (Fixes Issue #18)
* Update research locations for TC 4.2.2.x
* Changed the tooltip for the Energy Collector to be less misleading (Ref Issue #22)
* Cleaned up quests:
  - Better flow (visual)
  - Backup quests are marked as such
  - Note added to chapter 1
  - Repeatable quests now all have an interval, immediate can be confusing
  - Gem armor quests are now repeatable, changed from detect to submit
* Sugar, sugarcane and paper are now 4 EMC to reduce the impact of a coming mod on early game balance
* Voiced lore now auto plays
* Changed covalence dust recipes to fit our progression
* Fixed greatwood and silverwood planks emc
* Adjusted some Fairy Tales lore texts (AMT TC integration)
* Mod update fixes
* Backpack mod is deprecated, will be changed to a different one in the next update. Make sure to clean out all backpacks before the next update. In preparation, backpacks have now an EMC value so you can "cash" them in.
* Opis/Mapmaker is removed in favour of Journeymap in THIS update, make sure to note down your markers before updating
* Gravestones config change to disable fog (odd dusk/dawn visuals)
* More EMC values (Witchery plants/crops/null catalyst, BoP plants/mushrooms)
* Made Erebus bamboo compatible with BoP bamboo, to prevent EMC snafu, BoP bamboo no longer works as vanilla stick.
* Progression now mandates the bambucket for Botania
  - "Gold" bucket recipe removed, bucket EMC restored
  - BoP bamboo shoots are craftable
  - Quest added to highlight this feature
* Further improved quest flow
