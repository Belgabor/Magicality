Magicality Changelog
====================

Unreleased
----------
* More sensible burn time vs. EMC settings. Coal is now 32 EMC, ProjectE fuel recipes were changed so their EMC values are as uncghanged as possible (only alchemical fuel has half it's previuos EMC now). Burn times were changed accordingly, all ProjectE fuels therefore burn now significantly longer.
* Removed and (if necessary) replaced all AMT recipes that use tin or silver. This also gets rid of the empty bottle/bottle case exploit
* Fixed diamond to emerald transmutaion exploit. Recipe now requires 8 iron ingots
* Fixed dm recipe so it's no longer a massive EMC gain
* Changed some recipes that use dm/rm blocks so they don't suffer that much from making the matter blocks regular storage blocks
* Fixed some quest text typos / omissions
