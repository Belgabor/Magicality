Magicality Changelog
====================

Alpha 3.0 (Unreleased)
----------------------
* **IMPORTANT**: The Backpack mod is deprecated, will be changed to a different one in the next update. Make sure to clean out all backpacks before the next update. In preparation, backpacks have now an EMC value so you can "cash" them in.
* **IMPORTANT**: The item for the Apple, Milk & Tea Cooking Iron Plate has changed, exchange it for the new one in a crafting grid
* More sensible burn time vs. EMC settings. Coal is now 32 EMC, ProjectE fuel recipes were changed so their EMC values are as unchanged as possible (only alchemical fuel has half it's previous EMC now). Burn times were changed accordingly, all ProjectE fuels therefore burn now significantly longer.
* Removed and (if necessary) replaced all AMT recipes that use tin or silver. This also gets rid of the empty bottle/bottle case exploit (Fixes Issue #5)
* Fixed diamond to emerald transmutation exploit. Recipe now requires 8 iron ingots
* Fixed dm recipe so it's no longer a massive EMC gain
* Changed some recipes that use dm/rm blocks so they don't suffer that much from making the matter blocks regular storage blocks
* Fixed some quest text typos / omissions
* Made it possible to get ender shards in the overworld. No spoilers, but there is a hint in your beginner shard entry =)
* Removed EMC from items that aren't supposed to have one (Shards, ore clusters, thaumium leggings)
* Changed emerald shard recipe (Fixes Issue #16)
* Gem of Eternal Density now requires red matter (Fixes Issue #17)
* Make red matter quest detection (Fixes Issue #18)
* Update research locations for TC 4.2.2.x
* Changed the tooltip for the Energy Collector to be less misleading (Ref Issue #22)
* Cleaned up quests:
  - Better flow (visual)
  - Backup quests are marked as such
  - Note added to chapter 1
  - Repeatable quests now all have an interval, immediate can be confusing
  - Gem armor quests are now repeatable, changed from detect to submit
* Sugar, sugarcane and paper are now 4 EMC to reduce the impact of a coming mod on early game balance
* Voiced lore now auto plays
* Changed covalence dust recipes to fit our progression
* Fixed greatwood and silverwood planks emc
* Adjusted some Fairy Tales lore texts (AMT TC integration, updates in AMT)
* Mod update fixes
* Opis/Mapmaker is removed in favour of Journeymap in THIS update, make sure to note down your markers before updating
* Gravestones config change to disable fog (odd dusk/dawn visuals)
* More EMC values (Witchery plants/crops/null catalyst, BoP plants/mushrooms)
* Made Erebus bamboo compatible with BoP bamboo, to prevent EMC snafu, BoP bamboo no longer works as vanilla stick.
* Gold bucket recipe removed, was never necessary since glass bottles can be used.
  - Bambucket can be used for water transport (part of the AgriCraft quest line)
  - BoP bamboo shoots are craftable
  - Quest added to highlight this feature
* Further improved quest flow
* Changed recipes to acommodate the fact that red matter and gem helmet have TC revealing built in
* Removed TC loot bags, iron, gold and diamonds from regular chest loot
* Added AgriCraft. Thaumcraft shards are now grown. Witchery plants need to be cross-bred
* Make sure item renames work in all languages
* Nodes in Jars added to NEI for testing in Creative
* Rebalanced Botania alchemy and conjuration infusions for EMC on mana rather than EMC basis. As a consequence glowstone EMC is reverted to default and a lot of infusion recipes now need more mana, in some cases considerably more. Please note that the Botania NEI integration is not indended for mana requirements as large as some of these, it shows mana requirements on a 1:10 scale. Several of the changed recipes will cap this.
* Added a recipe for Blaze spawn eggs in case you have trouble finding a nether fortress
* Added aspects to a couple of items
* Made mana yuzus more expensive
* AMT grater is now available early game
