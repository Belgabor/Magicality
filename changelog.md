Magicality Changelog
====================

Unreleased
----------
* More sensible burn time vs. EMC settings. Coal is now 32 EMC, ProjectE fuel recipes were changed so their EMC values are as unchanged as possible (only alchemical fuel has half it's previous EMC now). Burn times were changed accordingly, all ProjectE fuels therefore burn now significantly longer.
* Removed and (if necessary) replaced all AMT recipes that use tin or silver. This also gets rid of the empty bottle/bottle case exploit (Fixes Issue #5)
* Fixed diamond to emerald transmutation exploit. Recipe now requires 8 iron ingots
* Fixed dm recipe so it's no longer a massive EMC gain
* Changed some recipes that use dm/rm blocks so they don't suffer that much from making the matter blocks regular storage blocks
* Fixed some quest text typos / omissions
* Made it possible to get ender shards in the overworld. No spoilers, but there is a hint in your beginner shard entry =)
* Shards gained an EMC value, removed (were never intended to have one)
* Changed emerald shard recipe (Fixes Issue #16)
* Gem of Eternal Density now requires red matter (Fixes Issue #17)
* Make red matter quest detection (Fixes Issue #18)
* Update research locations for TC 4.2.2.x
* Changed the tooltip for the Energy Collector to be less misleading (Ref Issue #22)
* Cleaned up quests:
  - Better flow (visual)
  - Backup quests are marked as such
  - Note added to chapter 1
  - Repeatable quests now all have an interval, immediate can be confusing
  - Gem armor quests are now repeatable, changed from detect to submit
* Sugar, sugarcane and paper are now 4 EMC to reduce the impact of a coming mod on early game balance
* Voiced lore now auto plays
