#Define custom crops here: <name>,<fruit:fruitmeta>,<baseblock:baseblockmeta>,<tier>,<rendermethod>,<information>
# - name:         is the name of the crop you want, for example: claysanthemum
# - fruit:        the fruit you want the crop to produce, for example: minecraft:clay:0 (metadata is optional, you can get this from NEI)
# - baseblock:    this is the block that has to be underneath for the plant to grow, for example: (this can also be gotten from NEI, if you don't want to specify, type null)
# - tier:         from 1 to 5, the higher, the slower the crop will grow
# - rendermethod: put 1 to render like a flower (in an X-pattern), put 6 to render like wheat (hashtag-pattern)
# - information:  put a short description (in the same line) of the crop. This will appear in the journal
#you will need to make a texture pack and add textures for the crops in agricraft/blocks with the name cropName1, cropName2, cropName3, cropName4
#where name is the name you specified here, there have to be 4 textures, texture 4 is the mature one
#for the seed texture, put a texture named seedName in the agricraft/items of your resourcepack
#Example: claysanthemum,minecraft:clay,minecraft:hardened_clay,2,6,a crop that extracts clay from the soil to grow clay buds.
#this will need textures cropClaysanthemum1, cropClaysanthemum2, Claysanthemum3, Claysanthemum4 in the agricraft/textures/blocks folder and seedClaysanthemum in the agricraft/textures/items folder of your resourcepack.
#Note the capitalization, always put a capital in the texture name. Also, this crop will not grow unless it has a hardened clay block underneath the block of farmland it's on
