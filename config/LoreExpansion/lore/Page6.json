	Spring came and went after the events of Christmas time and summer was beginning. I was beginning to feel invisible. The voice in me head has started laughing at me, calling me weak. I needed to disappear. I decided it would be today.
	Gathering up my potions I had been crafting I sat inside my lab, at my table, thinking. How could I make myself invisible. It had become not a hobby anymore. I needed to create things otherwise the voice in my head got stronger and more irritated with me.
	After a few days with very little to eat or drink I had finally come up with a stable way of making me invisible. The voice was still there, in fact it was goading me, telling me that it needed to work and it became not a personal project but one that needed to be done for some impending doom the voice was saying.
	'It's going to take them, It can't know you are here' it would say. At this point I think I began to accept the voice as a separate entity all together. It didn't seem like part of me was saying this any longer and had taken it's own form.
	The next day I gathered my robe I was no longer wearing to keep the cold away and lathered it in the substance I had created. My eyes must have been wild with excitement when I put it around my shoulders and the voice was pleased. I tested it right then, sneaking outside. A small deer was grazing on the far side of my house, nibbling on the flowers there. The deer looked up when it herd me come closer but couldn't place where the sound was coming from and it was until I was a few feet away the deer sensed something wasn't right and bolted off. Success!
