Whoever is reading this journal of mine I do hope you'll take care of it! I'm a wizard you see, well, I WAS a Wizard. Now I appear to have died...quite unfortunate I have to say but I am 3201 years old, quite proud of that!
Anyway, ahem, here lies with me...oh no that's quite morbid I can't use that, ahem, within these pages are some of my greatest tales. My wondrous exploits into the world of Minecraftia! Do you think yourself worthy of feasting your eyes upon these pages? Read on friend and think again!
I'm a wizard, I'm sure I've told you that already! I'm a magical being, of course, this book is magical! You cannot hear my tales unless you join me for those tales! That's the magic, Exciting isn't it?",
