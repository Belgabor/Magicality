"body": "Together with your friend you hold feast in the wizards honour. The food is excellent and he shares many a story with you, funny and serious, adventurous and banal.
Sated and joined in a drink, the mood gets more diminished. Through his journal and the fairy's stories you feel as if you almost know him. So even if you never met the old wizard, your heart gets heavy.
'You know,' you friend starts in a voice so silent you almost cannot hear, 'I've been stranded on this plane for, for... Heck, I can't even remember. He was the first and only one that ever talked to me in all this time.'
'He even tried to help me. Hm, guess I never told you. Yeah, I'm good with nature here, but there is something amiss. My magic doesn't really, how should I say, connect. Every 100 years or so I need to hibernate to recover my energy.'
As he stops you look over to him. You hadn't though he could look more deject than he already had, but he does.
He draws a heavy breath and continues: 'Maybe if I had held out a bit longer, maybe I'd been around. Maybe I could have helped, maybe he wouldn't be...'
Shocked you realize that he blames himself. You tell him that in his weakened state it was very unlikely he could have helped and that he'd likely be dead now as well.
The smile he shows you as a response is forced.
'Thanks for trying to cheer me up, but this is something I need to work out on my own. I'll get over it I guess, time heals all wounds they say.'
'I'm sorry, but I need to be on my own for a while. I'll see ya tomorrow.'
Not knowing what to do, you can only watch your friend slink away into the darkness. Feeling powerless to help, your face grows grim. Someone has a huge tab open and you are determined to collect."
