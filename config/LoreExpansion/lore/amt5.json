"body":"Many beverages can be turned into icecream. Most need to have had milk added, but not all. Put the cup into the top slot, cool it down and on you go. You'll get the cup back. Here, I saved a rarity for you to try. Don't waste it.
To cool the ice maker you can use snow or ice. Snow isn't very efficient, so be prepared to collect lots if you plan to use that."
