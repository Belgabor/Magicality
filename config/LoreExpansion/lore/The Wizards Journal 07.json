	Time has no substance or purpose now. I live to pass the time and complete small projects for the voice. He wasn't happy anymore, I needed to up my game. Spells weren't cutting it and I was to test my creation capabilities on a ranged weapon.
	It wasn't to be a more powerful bow, oh no, the voice wanted more than that. He wanted small projectiles capable of very high velocities. It was back to my drawing board once again, head down, hardly eating or drinking and surfacing only when I was told to rest.
	It wasn't easy and many failures later I had a few parts that together created what I liked to call...a gun. It didn't fire arrows, it fired small metal cartridges. It didn't use human power to pull back a string but used gunpowder from those explosive creepers! Finally a use for those pesky green creatures!
	The gunpowder when ignited created such a force and a band down the barrel of the gun that the metal object inside would rip trees apart when fired at it. The voice was pleased, and in a strange way...so was I. My mind is slipping, I feel myself getting an even smaller grip on the reality i'm in and the voice taking over me.
