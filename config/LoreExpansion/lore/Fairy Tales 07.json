"body":"Let's get your clay pan working. The clay pan is used to boil ingredients, so we need a heat source below it. Lava is too hot, so you'll need to use fire. That magical heat stuff also works.
To get started, put the ingredients into the pan with your right hand. Here, have some rare ones to get started. Each ingredient is good for several servings, just use an empty bowl on the pan to get one out.
The pan can also be used to cover items in chocolate. Make some minced chocolate, and I'll show you how to do that."
