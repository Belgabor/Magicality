"body":"You found a yuzu? Great, quick, craft it into a sapling if you didn't harvest one and plant a tree.
Yuzu can be made into food and beverages. They also play a very special role on this plane. They seem to be very receptive to the magical currents and are able to store magical energy. The old wizard came up with some magical contraptions that can make use of this energy. If you want to know more about that, dump a yuzu into one of these mana ponds or whatever they are called, I'll tell you more afterwards."
