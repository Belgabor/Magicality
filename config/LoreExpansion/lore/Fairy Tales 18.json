The wind charm allows you to remember a position and return to it. Register a position by using the charm on the ground. Be careful though, once a position is set it cannot be changed. Also the charm gets confused if used in a different dimension. It cannot traverse the dimension border but may still try to transport you. Depending on where that is, it may not be a position you want to be in. If you have several it is probably a good idea to rename them in an anvil, but this slightly interferes with their magic, you should only rename them once their position is set, otherwise they become useless.
The moon charm is somewhat similar, it allows you to escape cave system by transporting you straight up. This will only work if the block you'd be transported to is grass or, if it has open sky above it, snow or ice. It does not work in the Nether.
Both of these can be attached to a chalcedony pressure plate and activate if someone steps on it.
The other two charms work if you have them with you. One of them increases monster loot, the other one the amount of experience you get when slaying a monster"
