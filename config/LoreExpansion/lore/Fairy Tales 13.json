That food processor allows you to do most of the grater recipes without wasting resources. Not all can be done in it though, some not even in any machine. There are also some special recipes that can only be done in the processor.
The jaw crusher allows you to make some special ingredients. It also helps you to get some basic materials and recover materials from some used tools.
The evaporator extracts liquids from items or other liquids. It is essential for creating incense and stronger spirits.
Now while working with these machines the old cozer mumbled a couple of things I didn't quite get. He said they are all 'eyesided', guess he was at my mushrooms again, never saw any eyes on them...
Apparently that let his golloms interact with them in some special way. Just tellin ya, maybe you can make something from it...
Now next you might want to look into making some of the stronger stuff. Make one of those brewing barrels to get started.
Also I suggest you make some camelia saplings. The oil can be useful for some advanced crafting."
