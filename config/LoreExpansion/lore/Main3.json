"body":"'Ah good so you managed to figure it out eh? Perhaps there is potential in you yet my protege… Now from here we should have the materials to make an absolutely fabulous altar! Why an altar I hear you asking with a whining quality in your voice that I hate so much? Sacrificing blood of course! Your blood! Or somebody else’s if you can convince them, but probably yours! Everything of value has a price, my boy and/or girl, and making a little trade in the currency of blood, well, that’s just normal wizard grocery shopping, isn’t it? Now now don’t be shy, surely you feel a nosebleed coming on, no cuts even required! Maybe just squeeze a little bit? No? Come on, hero, we need this final resource before you can really get properly rolling as a great and powerful wizard. Just one little nosebleed over the altar with a golden ingot as a focal point to remind the iron in your blood of what it was supposed to be doing in the first place, and then..!” *cough* “Actually, come to think of it, you’ll probably be better off using something properly sterilized to get this done with surgical precision.  Make a sacrificial dagger or something, ideally something clear so it will be easy to see if it gets dirty, can’t have our great hero getting an infection when he pricks his finger for the cause of science, magic, world peace, what were we working on again? Magic, right, and returning resources to this forsaken rock.'",
