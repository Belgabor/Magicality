You should already have what you need, so Henceforth I proclaim you to be worthy of the power of flight, go ahead go nuts and make every flight based item you can imagine, flying free in the air, until ultimately you realize you were never a creature meant for flight and crash into a tower or something. By that point you’ll ask yourself why you ever wanted to fly in the first place… And quite frankly I don’t know why you would either. Childish nonsense. Teleportation is the thing.' When you’ve finished gawping at the book like a thirsty trout, unsuccessful in your attempts to fathom what it must mean, it resumes speaking.
	'Back to the matter at hand, Now that you have brought to be this combination of twilight goodies, we can work on giving it a more unified form. Probably you should drench it in blood or something equally ghastly, rivers of it I should suspect. After all, it might take nigh-upon ten or fifteen minutes to think up a more civilized way to produce our final product… A home made portal to the nefarious realm of the evil doing warchief of destruction (trandmark pending).'",
