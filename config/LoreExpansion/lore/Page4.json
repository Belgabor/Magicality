	After the terrible incident with the spawners things quietened down and I began to accept my life here on this world. I have no idea how I got here, I have no idea what I had before but I know I had something before this. There is something lingering in my mind that tells me so!
	After this realization I had decided that instead of fighting this world, I would prepare in this world for all eventualities! My makeshift lab was too small. My house was made of all sorts of different woods and materials that really it was just a patchwork of blocks. I had no real food growing, no animals to tend to.
	I had decided things had to change. I felt there was no way back and the voice in my head told me so, I needed to get on with things, keep my mind busy, the voice would say. I was sat on the lakeside thinking of my love lost. Thinking what I could do next.
	I needed to get back to my work, as the voice said, to find things that needed to be found. To progress. Maybe if I did that I could go back to whatever came before?
	I returned later in the day to my lab, the floor piled high with books, items strewn all over a wood block I used for a desk. It was time to put things in their place!
