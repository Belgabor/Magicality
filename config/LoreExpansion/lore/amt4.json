"body":"Ah, the tea maker. Fine instrument of procuring beverages.
To make a beverage, put the ingredient into it with your right hand. Each ingredient is good for 3 to 5 drinks, depending on which one it is. Here, have one of my favourite ones, give it a try!
How to get a drink you ask? Well, a tea cup of course! Here, take one of my old ones, but they are not hard to make if you need more or loose it. Just use it on the tea maker to get a drink.
You can also use a bucket of milk on a filled maker to enhance most of the beverages, makes them even more healthy! Milked beverages are also usually the base for icecream, but I'll tell you more about that once you craft an ice maker.
Last but not least, if you want you can automate it. One of these comparactor doodads can read how many drinks remain and a dispensensor can refill it."
