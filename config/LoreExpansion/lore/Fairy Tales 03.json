"body":"You made the grater? Then we can get started. Many ingredients need to be grated before you can use them to make food or drinks. The grater is the simplest way to do so.
Grating also makes cassis and yuzu fruits edible.
Together with the wizard we made a more automatic way to grate or otherwise process food, but you'll need to find a yuzu first if you haven't already.

But grating is only the beginning, I can teach you how to make beverages or cook with the pan or iron plate.
The tea maker allows you to make beverages with several useful effects, this is probably the first thing you should aim for.
Both the pan and the iron plate allow you to make better food if you have the necessary ingredients.
Make the item and I'll show you how to use it."
