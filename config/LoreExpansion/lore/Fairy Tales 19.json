"body": "With incense you can spread a magical effect over a certain area. Since you're a clever one you'll be able to find out yourself how to craft the incense, but I'll explain the effects to you that are not common or self-explanatory. One thing though, not all essential oils can be crafted, some can only be found in loot chests or bought from villagers.
To use the incense, put it into an incense base and light it with a fire starter or regular flint and steel. The base can hold as much incense as you can carry in a hand.
The calm effect will put everybody around at rest, adding slowness and weakness to all players and creatures around it.
The freeze effect will freeze water and turn lava into obsidian.
The hypnotic effect is an interesting one, it will cause hostile creatures to drop their armour.
The tranquilizer effect slows down passive animals and hostile creatures.
The sanctuary effect will make the area peaceful. All hostile creatures are removed from existence."
