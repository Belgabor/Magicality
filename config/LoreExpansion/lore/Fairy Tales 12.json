"body":"Now setting these up is pretty simple. The only magical energy you can convert into natural flux is that flower manamana. Put down the Fluxfield next to the charger block and point one of these manna sprinklers at it.
The charger should then refill any natural flux containers you put into it as long as you have enough flower energy."
