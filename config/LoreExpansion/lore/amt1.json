Guess you never seen a fairy like me *chuckle*. Name's Rosebud by the way. Smirk tells me you know how the kids called me in school. Guess mom and pop had some mushroom stew before the Naming. Still, a fairy I am, spirit of nature at your service!
Since you've been nice to the old man I guess I'll help you out for a bit. Yeah, he'd probably have liked that. There's some special things on this plane that can help you a lot with that wizarding stuff. Maybe once we are through this you can get 'im a finer gravestone, he always liked green, like the emeralds those villagers trade with.
Let's start with something familiar though, get me an apple and I'll show you what you can do here with it."
