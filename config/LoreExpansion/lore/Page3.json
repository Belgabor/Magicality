	The loss of my one love had hit me hard and in my depths of despair I found comfort in a place I really should not have delved. I thought at the time Necromancy would give me a release, would give me minions to fill my long, lonely Autumn nights! What I created though was a monster!
	I created, what I thought to be, 2 minions. This wasn't to be the case as when the first minion spawned it had only eyes for my Wizard Blood! I managed to unsheathe my wand in time to cast a spell that blew him to pieces. It didn't end though, from the spot where I tried to create my minions monsters appeared and poured forwards in numberless waves!
	I had to retreat to my lab in the end, piled up everything behind the door and work on a creation to send them back from whence they came! In my haste I didn't write down my ingredients but I do still have those notes on what I can only describe as spawners. Maybe they can be of use to someone one day but I shall not touch them again!
	It took me three hours to whip together a spell. A spell so potent to the undead it would wipe them and those blasted spawners from this world for good. I have learned not to mess with the balance of nature, but cannot help feel lonely. Necromancy, however, is not the answer!
