"body":"Let's set up your iron plate. The iron plate is used to roast meat, so we need a heat source below it. Both fire and lava work. The wizard tried one of his arcane sources of heat, but it didn't work. That oversafe stuff is too tame for sizzeling meat.
To roast food, just put the raw meat or clam on the plate with your right hand. It'll turn into a meal once it's done. Some ingredients need more concentrated heat to cook, chicken is an example. To cook those you need to build an oven around the plate to contain the heat. Enclose the plate on three sides and the top, that should be enough."
