"body":"Let's set up your iron plate. The iron plate is used to roast meat, so we need a heat source below it. Both fire and lava work. The wizard tried one of his arcane sources of heat, but it didn't work. That oversafe stuff is too tame for sizzeling meat.
To roast food, just put the raw meat or clam on the plate with your right hand. Wait a bit, when it darkens it's a sign that the meat is done. Just pull it off quickly with an empty hand. Clams open when they are done."
