First make the base. Moromi and Wort can be made with the crops that grow on this plane. Then you either need to pour it into a properly placed barrel or distillate it in the Extractor to make the base for spirits, which then go into the barrel.
Proper barrel placement is inside and within a region that is neither too cold nor too warm. Touch it with your right hand to find out if it's not in the right spot.
Once you put the base into the barrel it needs to age four days before it's drinkable. Touch the barrel with your right hand to check it's state.
Once it's done, you can fill bottles from the barrel, a full barrel is good for five. Here, have some rare base you can brew and some bottles to fill.
Finally spirits can be made into cordials, several kinds of liqueur. It needs to age again, but does so in it's own bottle. Just place it down, same rules apply as for the barrel.
Oh, I almost forgot the most important part. Here on this plane we are no savages, you cannot drink directly from a bottle. Place it down and use your trusty cup on it to get a drink."
