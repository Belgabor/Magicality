That’ll teach it to keep it’s lackies from invading our world… Lousy tourists, always messing around with things they aren’t meant to be touching, asking nosy questions , or making culturally insensitive cracks.. Pardon, I was just remembering a summer job I had as a tour book of this dimension. Within moments I almost started to tear out my own pages. Some really bright sparks they are, the whole lot of them. Let’s just say I’m not going to weep maidenly tears of loss if some endermen have an ‘accident’ while you’re there.' You attempt to imagine the Narranomicon guiding a gaggle of Endermen along before a grumpy cough returns you to the present. 
'Are you with us again? Good. Now that we are so close to getting our revenge, I suggest you take this time to prepare. Of course a mighty hero like you could win the coming fight in underwear wielding a sharpened spoon. But Maybe still go invest in some final armor that’s representative of your magical prowess. You might not need it, but imagine standing on the corpses of your fallen foes looking like a beggar. Anticlimactic, don’t you think? The dragon feels safe and content ruling the skies there and will do all it can to make you regret this Final Task. I’m certain the endermen there aren’t going to be happy about it either… We are giving them a taste of there own medicine after all! But! We plan on giving them the same medicine ten fold! They won’t keep me-ah, er, us from what is ours ever again. Now then, Huzzah, on your way, Geronons’ y!'",
