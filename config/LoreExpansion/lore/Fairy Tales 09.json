"body":"Ah, you found tea and cassis saplings, best go plant them so they can grow. One hint, if you break the bushes once they are fully grown, there is a chance you get two saplings. But with that magic transmorphication thingy you probably won't need to do that.
To harvest, wait till it's fully grown and pluck the leaves or fruits with an empty right hand. Collecting more if you already have some in your hand also works.
Tea makes for some nice beverages, cassis for some nice food."
