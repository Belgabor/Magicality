"body":"Clams are a very useful resource, but before using the one you found you should plant it back into sand below water. It will spread into adjacent sand and yield more clams.
Be careful though, overcrowded clams usually die. With some luck it will rather transform into something worthwhile though. Make sure to always harvest with your right hand, otherwise you might damage the rarity.
Calms can be cooked in a furnace or on an iron plate. If ground down, they can either be used as an ingredient for other dishes or used as a fertilizer."
